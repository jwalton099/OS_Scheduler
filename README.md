# OS_Scheduler

C++ Program using Unix to Simulate a CPU's Process Scheduler

The commander.cpp is compiled and ran using input.txt and cin to read input commands. The commander will then execute the process_manager.cpp and send commands via pipes to the process manager. This manager will then parse the input data and perform a certain action based on the data it is presented. Finally, once all commands have been run, both programs will terminate.
